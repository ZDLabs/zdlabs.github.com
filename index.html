          <p>There are a number of hand-crafted apps that have already been created to serve our customers, which may be accessed by a team member and implemented to order.
          <br>
          This documentation is intended to reveal some of the options available for those who wish to customize their Zendesk account, and the plug-ins described herein are to be understood to be of an 'experimental' nature, meaning that they are not as of now an official offering nor part of the Zendesk core product, but should give you an idea of the options for which we have already coded up a solution.
