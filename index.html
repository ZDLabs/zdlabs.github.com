        <h3>Welcome.</h3>

<p>There are a number of hand-crafted apps that have already been created to serve our customers, which may be accessed by a team member and implemented to order.
<br>
This documentation is intended to reveal some of the options available for those who wish to customize their Zendesk account, and the plug-ins described herein are to be understood to be of an 'experimental' nature, meaning that they are not as of now an official offering nor part of the Zendesk core product, but should give you an idea of the options for which we have already coded up a solution.
</p>

<h3 id="top-three-apps">Our Top Three Agent Extensions</h3>
<p>These are some of the most-requested, frequently ask-about, and pridefully dashing add-ons created and vetted by our own services team.
  <ul class="top-three">
    <li>
      <h4><a href="3">Html App</a></h4>
      <p>This is just an app to display HTML links in the ticket sidebar. Just edit the links.hdbs with the links you want to show</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
      <h4><a href="3">Conditional Fields</a></h4>
      <p>This app requires configuration, but it enables the ticket form to show and hide certain fields based on user selection or other criteria</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
      <h4><a href="3">Create Ticket in Spoke</a></h4>
      <p>Allows an agent to create a ticket in a spoke account from inside the hub account ticket view</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3 id="generic-apps">Generic Add-Ons</h3>

<p>These are extensions that can be plugged right in to any account with little to no configuration to get up and running
  <ul class="generic">
    <li>
      <h4><a href="3">Updated-At Display</a></h4>
      <p>Shows the date that an article was updates at in forums rather than just the date that it was created</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
      <h4><a href="3">Html App</a></h4>
      <p>This is just an app to display HTML links in the ticket sidebar. Just edit the links.hdbs with the links you want to show</p>
    </li>    
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

<h3 id="assembly-required">Some Assembly Required</h3>
<p>Here are some apps and widgets that are tried and true, but which require a technical hand to configure for each account that they are applied to.
